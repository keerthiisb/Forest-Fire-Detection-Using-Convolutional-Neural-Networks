# Forest-Fire-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
A deep learning-based project for early detection of forest fires through video analysis enabling timely interventions to minimize damage.

1.Overview

Forest fire detection is critical to mitigating environmental, economic, and social damages caused by wildfires. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify forest fires from images and video feeds. By utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the system achieves early detection, enabling rapid responses and minimizing damage.

2.Features

Early detection of forest fires using a trained CNN model.
Real-time detection through live video feeds.
Dataset preprocessing and segmentation for optimized training.
Integration of Flask for a web-based user interface.

3.Software Requirements

➢ Operating system : Windows XP/7 
➢ Coding Language : PYTHON 
➢ Tool : Anaconda Navigator 

4. Hardware Constraints

➢ System : Pentium IV 2.4 GHz  
➢ Hard Disk : 40 GB
